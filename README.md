# daily yayo bot
OUTDATED & DOESN'T WORK: Misskey must have updated their API, but for now (or ever probably) I'm not going to update it.

うっうー！

A simple program used for the bot account @daily_yayo on Misskey server 'misskey.io'. It uploads an image of Yayo from 'Puchimas!' everyday at a given time.

View the account here: https://misskey.io/@daily_yayo

Note that the image file is not provided and needs to be uploaded individually to the Misskey account.

## Automation
The automation of the bot is done using the .bat file and Windows Task Scheduler.
